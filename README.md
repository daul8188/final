# Global GDP and CO₂ Emissions Dataset (1960–2022)

This dataset combines GDP and CO₂ emissions data at the country level for longitudinal and comparative analysis. It merges economic and environmental indicators to support research into sustainability, development trajectories, and global inequality.

## What's Included

This dataset provides harmonized annual records for over 180 countries and territories. It includes core economic and emissions indicators, derived metrics, and regional metadata for filtering or grouping.

### File Structure

- `gdp_co2_by_country.csv`: Final cleaned dataset
- `data_descriptions.txt`: Column dictionary and notes

Notes:

- All monetary values are in constant USD for comparability.
- Log and winsorized columns are included to support robust statistical analysis.
- Outlier columns are based on z-score thresholds.
- Categories are based on quantiles or World Bank definitions.
- The dataset is suitable for time series, cross-sectional, and panel analysis.
